# DXDumpy
Python script to store and load DX synth patches

### Usage
All patches are saved and loaded as a [.syx](https://fileinfo.com/extension/syx) file.
- List all available ports: 
```console
python3 dxdumpy -l <port> <path>```
- Dump from the synth:
```console
python3 dxdumpy -d <port> <path>```
- Export to the synth:
```console
python3 dxdumpy -e <port> <path>```

Some [links to DX patches](http://nuxmicromedia.com/4ophq/cgi-bin/dx4op.cgi?mode=patch) you can download and play around with.
